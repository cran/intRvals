\title{Dataset with dropping intervals observed for foraging Brent Geese (Branta bernicla bernicla)}
\format{An object of class \code{data.frame} with 705 rows and 7 columns.}
\usage{
goosedrop
}
\description{
The dataset contains observations from two sites: the island of Schiermonnikoog (saltmarsh) and Terschelling (agricultural grassland).
Brent geese were observed continuously with spotting scopes, and the time when geese excreted a dropping was written down.
The time in seconds between wo subsequently observed dropping arrivals of a single individual refers to one dropping interval.
The variables are as follows:
\describe{
  \item{\code{date}}{observation start time of the interval}
  \item{\code{interval}}{length of the interval in seconds}
  \item{\code{bout_length}}{total observation time of individual}
  \item{\code{prop_abdomen_seen}}{proportion of total observation time when abdomen could be observed}
  \item{\code{bout_id}}{intervals belonging to the same observation bout of an individual have the same \code{bout_id}}
  \item{\code{site}}{observation site. One of 'terschelling' (agricultural grassland) or 'schiermonnikoog' (salt marsh)}
  \item{\code{period}}{two-week observation period (1-5)}
}
